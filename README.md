# Data Structures Practice (HongLab Course)

This repository contains my daily hands-on exercises based on the **Data Structures course by HongLab**. The course is available [here](https://www.honglab.ai/courses/data-structures), and provides clear explanations and practical examples for understanding the fundamental data structures used in computer science.

## 📘 Course Overview

The course covers the following topics:

- Arrays and Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, BST)
- Graphs (Adjacency list/matrix, DFS/BFS)
- Hash Tables
- Heaps
- Sorting Algorithms
- Recursion and Backtracking

Each topic is accompanied by C++ examples and practical coding challenges.

## 🛠️ What You'll Find Here

In this repository, I document my daily progress by implementing and experimenting with the data structures discussed in the course. Each folder corresponds to a topic from the course and includes:

- Clean and commented C++ code
- My own notes and variations
- Additional test cases or improvements (when applicable)

> ✅ I try to commit daily as I go through the lessons. This is an ongoing learning project.

## 🔧 Tools & Environment

- Language: C++
- IDE: Xcode (macOS)
- Compiler: Apple Clang

## 📌 Goals

- Solidify understanding of core data structures
- Improve C++ proficiency
- Prepare for technical interviews
